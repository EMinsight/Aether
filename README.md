# Aether

Aether is an open-source optical simulations suite, coded in C++ for Windows and Linux, born out of the research and needs at the L2n laboratory in France, which is part of the University of Technology of Troyes.

It is an evolving project and might be subject to numerous changes.

# Features

## GUI

* FDTD simulations
* Raytracing
* Multilayer's optical response
* Graphical fit of data
* Human assisted planar modes solver
* Mie theory: cross-sections calculation
* Graphical samples organizer
* For the classroom:
  * visualisation of the ellipsometric concepts
  * 2D SEM particles simulation

## CLI

* FDTD simulations
* FDFD simulations (2D)
* Raytracing
* Multilayer's optical response


# A bit of history

The oldest roots of the software originate back in 2008 with personnal rendering projects.

This was followed two years later by an internship at the L2n on the ADI-FDTD method, which served as the basis for the FDTD module. Concurrent development happened through the OpenSource Gneiss project (now obsolete), dedicated to rendering space scenes.

The FDTD code was then developed during a PhD under the ANR MetaPhotonique project, together with some basic tools.

A few years later under the TurboPET project, the raytracing core was coded by integrating Gneiss' original raytracer into Aether.

Since then, many improvements have been added, like the GUI, and from 2015 onwards several upgrades were designed to accomodate the Limule project, a proprietary software coded for the In-Fine joint laboratory.

In 2021 the aim was to finally launch it as an OpenSource project of its own.
